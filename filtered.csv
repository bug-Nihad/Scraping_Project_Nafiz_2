I reckon we will see CSL under $31.00 today. I do not expect it to reach its lowest point till about 12-ish. My entry target is around $30.80. If we get there today I will start loading up but won't rush in as I will be waiting for another confirmation from the USA tonight. If DOW falls again (100+ points) I will sit it out until there is a bit more data which will help me determine the direction of the markets (ST). If DOW recovers (50+ points) or falls by some 20-30 points I will back up my truck and load up.

Worst case scenario - CSL falls today by some 40-50 cents and then DOW drops hard tonight, I reckon we may be able to pick up some CSL closer to $29.00-29.30 in a day or two. My feeling is if CSL was to fall under $30.50 we would witness more volatile swings as about a year and 1/2 ago.

IF share price really drop to 30.80 as what RegularASX said, ill wait for another day or 2 for confirmation as market is very volatile at the moment. Although the TA shows slight uptrend (by the way anyone seeing similar trend?) however i still not very sure where it is heading. DJ dropped another 100+ point and i anticipate it will cause another % drop for CSL SP. At 30.80 level it have fallen close to the last 6 month low,(support level in May 2010).

Blood products maker CSL Ltd (ASX:CSL) has posted a full year net profit of $1.05 billion and announced a share buy-back plan for $900 million of its shares.

The profit represents a fall of 8.1% from the year before, however based on constant currency prices CSL recorded a profit of $1.24 billion up 22% for the 12 months to 30 June.

CSL has also increased its final dividend 13% to 45 cents.

Managing Director Dr McNamee says the strong result was achieved despite currency headwinds, rigorous competition and global health healthcare reform.

Looking ahead Dr McNamee says operational profit growth is expected to be solid, largely underpinned by ongoing growth in demand for plasma therapies.

CSL has forecast a net profit after tax of between $980 million and $1 billion for the following financial year.

Australia's largest healthcare company CSL Ltd (ASX:CSL) has had another hospital network join a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the biopharmaceutical company, according to The Age.

The paper says that Beth Israel Medical Centre, St Luke's and Roosevelt Hospital have joined a class action, claiming that CSL is involved in price fixing for its blood plasma products.

Driving down supply, inflating prices and eliminating competition are also part of the claims against CSL, says The Age.

CSL reportedly refutes the claims and states that it intends to defend the civil action.

The Age says that the last group to join the mounting lawsuit against blood plasma company CSL, is its main North American competitor, Baxter International.

ELI GREENBLAT
Fairfax June 10, 2010

THE Mayo Clinic has unexpectedly withdrawn from a multimillion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against blood plasma company CSL, and many other US hospitals have also walked away from the case.

It is believed the Mayo dropped its lawsuit last month. More than a dozen other hospitals and institutions also decided to remove their names as plaintiffs, leaving only a small number of litigants to push the case through the US courts.

On a visit to Australia this week, CSL's US-based global chief operating officer, Peter Turner, told analysts about the stunning reversal in fortunes regarding the looming court case, which was launched last July.

He also said CSL had taken market share in the US, although demand for plasma therapeutics remained lower, in line with the soft and fragile domestic economy.

Mr Turner is also reported to have told investors and analysts that he expected to be able to increase profit margins as well as revenue per litre, with smaller niche product launches and expanding markets.

During the briefings, he updated analysts on the potentially damaging and embarrassing lawsuit aimed at CSL and the news that most of the alleged victims had fallen away.

Fresh documents lodged in the courts show the antitrust lawsuit against CSL and its main rival, Baxter International - which once had nearly 20 plaintiffs - has been consolidated to now include only four plaintiffs.

The four institutions still suing CSL for allegedly fixing the price of life-saving blood plasma products are: the University of Utah, Hospital de Damas of Puerto Rico, pharmacy group Mak Medical and California's Comprehensive Blood and Cancer Centre.

But it is the retreat by the Mayo Clinic that could prove most damaging to the case against CSL as its name on the list of plaintiffs carried a lot of weight.

It is unclear why the Mayo and up to 14 other hospitals decided to drop the suit.

In its 62-page complaint, lodged this year, the clinic claimed it had been forced to pay ''supra-competitive prices'' for blood plasma products and that its business and property had been damaged. It went on to describe a highly complex and hidden conspiracy led by CSL that allegedly fixed the price of blood plasma by slashing supply.

''The alleged conspiracy artificially inflated the cost of delivering high-quality healthcare to patients in need of blood plasma protein therapy, and was undertaken with utter disregard for the likely adverse effects on patients of restricting the availability of blood plasma protein therapy,'' the Mayo said at the time.

CSL has said the claims were unsupported by fact and were without merit, and that it would vigorously defend the civil action.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Grifols, a Spanish health care group that makes blood-plasma treatments, said Monday it will buy U.S.-based Talecris Biotherapeutics for $3.4 billion.

Shares of Talecris (TLCR), based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., rose 48% in premarket trading.

The move will create a ""global leader of plasma protein therap[ies],"" the companies said in a release. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.

Barcelona-based Grifols will buy Talecris common stock for $19 in cash and 0.641 new, non-voting Grifols share for each Talecris share. The deal values Talecris shares at $26.16, a 53% premium over the average price of the stock over the last 30 days, according to Grifols.

Grifols said it expected to save $230 million in operating costs for plasma collection, manufacturing, marketing and research.

The combined company will generate about $2.8 billion in revenues per year, with 58% of that coming from North America.

An affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, which owns 49% of Talecris stock, said it will vote for the deal.

I actually pulled the trigger today in the high $31's. I like to trade CSL because:

1) it does not seem to drop by large amounts (<2%)like some other stocks.

2) quite often it trades against the mkt so there is often the opportunity to sell a green stock (CSL) and move into a red stock and vice-versa.

I am over trading speculative stocks as it is bad for my blood pressure and can no longer see the point of it with good blue chip opportunities available.

currency baseline 1% change to profit
AUD/USD 0.90 +/- $1.2m
AUD/EUR 0.60 +/- $2.0m
AUD/CHF 0.92 +/- $1.6m

So USD is now 0.81 (down 10% from baseline), EUR 0.66 (up 10%) and CHF 0.94 (up 2%)

So net profit change since 1/2 year report is 1.2 * 10 - 2 * 10 - 1.6 * 2 = -11.2m

So current currency prices have a negative impact on CSL profit for the year even with the big drop in the US dollar.

Also, as can be seen by the impact of a 1% change in a currency pair, the US change has some impact (1.2m) but the change in the Euro (2m) and Swiss Franc (1.6m) both have a much higher impact.

So as it stands the current currency values is still negative for CSL and if the Euro is in as bad shape as it appears the impact could become even worse.

Combine the above with the negative report from Baxter and it is no surprise sentiment is staying negative for CSL.

Thanks for the post. :)

I agree, investment managers are adjusting for the increased risk within the market - imo.

But lets be honest here... Where else will people place their money outside of cash and gov bonds? I wouldnt feel safe investing money in any of the banks or mining companies at the moment. For me i would be more willing to sit on my hands?

Its so erratic that, unless you are a champion TA, you will most likely get caught out. And also lets remember all the champion TA people that got caught out in the GFC.

If anything its been sold down / bought up (on relatively low volume) by day traders. Wouldnt see investment managers selling even from a risk perspective because the risk is not linked to banking or mining.

Currency risk is actually favouring CSL at the moment imo.
The lower the aus goes relative to the USD and EUR, the more profitable CSL becomes.

Just my thoughts on why CSL is a good buy given the current environment... As disclosed previously i sold half my holdings as i had to buy a few things with the profits and also i thought it was an opportune time to take some profits off the table.

I beleive that CSL is fundamentally sound, and by fundamentally sound i mean:

a) Profit expectations remain the same as advised by CSL
representatives
b) USD gaining over AUD where about 37.6% of CSL revenue is
derived from.
c) EUR gaining over AUD where at least 16.4% (GER) of CSL
revenue is derived from.
c) Expectation/confirmation that BAX.US losing market share
was due to increase market share to competitors, much of
it may be assumed to be by CSL.
d) CSL and those businesses that sell the same products are
within an inelastic market for that product. People can
go without a new car, but people cant go without their
health.

then CSL is severely underpriced.

Australia's two major sectors; mining and banking, are plagued by risk, with Mining with the Super tax and Banking with the risk associated with the EUR. One could state that CSL is a stock within the Aus market that has no such risks and is a good defensive stock to place money in. Just look at the % drop in price to some of the major mining/banking stocks relative to CSL...

Also when the GFC occured have a look at the SP of CSL... then have a look at your major mining and banking stocks...
If the next dip is going to occur, which it might just do (never say never) then one has to be more diligent in risk management...

From a T/A perspective i would love your thoughts on this. I have it as undersold. Its below the 195/200 ema line but imo dont see it below that line for too long. Thoughts?

Baxter to Recall COLLEAGUE Infusion Pumps in U.S.
DEERFIELD, Ill, May 3, 2010 - Baxter Healthcare Corporation today announced that it will recall COLLEAGUE infusion pumps from the U.S. market pursuant to an order under its existing June 2006 consent decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baxter will work with the FDA to ensure that the recall process provides customers appropriate alternatives for supporting patients' needs.

As previously disclosed, Baxter entered into a consent decree with FDA under which the company has been pursuing remediation of the infusion pumps. The decree permits FDA to require the recall of the pumps, and FDA has communicated to the company that it will require such a recall, with the company providing monetary consideration or replacement pumps to customers on a timeline to be determined with FDA and based on medical need. Baxter intends to work with FDA to minimize disruption to healthcare facilities using COLLEAGUE pumps. Baxter anticipates that, among alternatives to be provided to customers, the company will offer to exchange Baxter's Sigma SPECTRUM infusion pumps for COLLEAGUE infusion pumps without charge to customers.

The consent decree permits Baxter to propose alternative actions to achieve the FDA's objectives under the decree, which the company intends to do. The final nature of the recall and offer to customers remain subject to that ongoing dialogue. Once final, Baxter will notify customers and make information available on www.baxter.com.

Notwithstanding that uncertainty, the company currently anticipates that it will record a pre-tax special charge of $400 to $600 million in the first quarter for the reasonably estimable cost of the recall. The company is not otherwise revising its earnings guidance for the year in connection with the recall.

Healthcare analysts at Citi are doing a commendable job in keeping investors in Australia informed about what's happening in the US regarding demand for IVIG. Very important for CSL in Australia as CSL repatriates about 39% of its annual profits from the US.

Former take-over target Talecris has now confirmed that US demand in Q1 has been sluggish due to macro-influences. The US IVIG market is expected to return to its long term 6-8% annual growth at some point in the months ahead.

Regardless, Talecris has also indicated it will not exercise its ""top up"" option for increased supply from CSL in 2011. This, estimate Citi analysts, will deprive CSL from an estimated $20-30m in operational profits before tax (EBIT) next year. No changes made.",None

Citi analysts have been among the more vocal supporters of CSL shares, but in the meantime their forecasts and price target continues to slide downwards. No major changes have kicked in, however. Today's update includes lowered expectations for Gardasil and thus earnings expectations have gone down, by a little.

The target price drops some more, but remains above $40. The analysts point out that headline profit growth in FY11 is likely to look benign because the one-off effect from H1N1 vaccine sales in FY10 won't be repeated. Underlying, state the analysts, profit growth should still be around 12%.

The analysts may be staunch supporters of CSL, they also concede that a re-rating doesn't seem on the cards for the immediate future. But in twelve months time, when the world will look differently, their price target should be closer to the actual share price, the analysts predict.

http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/csl-boosted-by-offshore-rivals/story-e6frg9io-1225859820315

CSL's stock price is set to rebound today on the back of good results from offshore rivals that negate fears of a marked downturn in global plasma sales.

One time target Talecris posted an increase in first-half profits to $US45.3 million ($49m) from $33.4m and its stock price is trading 6 per cent higher in the US after-hours market, despite missing Wall Street revenue estimates.

European-based Grifols also reported a 5.3 per cent increase in plasma sales.

Neither result was a knockout due to the slow US and European economies, and Talecris also suffered a big contract loss but this much was expected.

Market concerns were raised when IVIG market leader Baxter cut estimates of the plasma product sharply due to the weak economy but the last two results show the Baxter weakness was due more to its own decisions than the market.

Baxter was trying a new route to market which has at least temporarily backfired.

CSL's share price fell from $37.15 a week ago to as low as $32.15 earlier in the week due to the Baxter news and fall out from some report problems with its flu drug.

The stock gained nearly 2 per cent yesterday to close at $33.08 and the rebound should continue today based on the latest results news.",LT

After witnessing the CSL share price take a bath over the past two trading sessions -down more than 12% in two days- Citi analysts have responded by stating investors are too harsh on the company.

The analysts draw a comparison with the 2003 experience when the US market for blood plasma was temporarily oversupplied and prices dropped by 20-25%. This month's market response looks similar to what happened back then, comment the analysts, but the real situation hardly is.

In other words: investors are too jumpy, the share price has fallen too much. CSL analysts argue if anything the blood plasma market lacks competition instead of risk becoming the victim of irrational competitive behaviour. Buy rating maintained with the comment that current multiples are too low for a company with such growth profile, balance sheet and future outlook.

Target price is $40.26 Current Price is $32.50 Difference: $7.76
If CSL meets the Citi target it will return approximately 24% (excluding dividends, fees and charges).
JP Morgan 27/04/2010 1 Overweight $41.68 25.5%

US competitor Baxter reported weak IVIG sales in its quarterly earnings but the broker suspects this is more to do with loss of market share than poor industry conditions.

While the Talecris result will provide further clues, the broker retains Overweight on CSL for now.

Target price is $41.68 Current Price is $32.50 Difference: $9.18
If CSL meets the JP Morgan target it will return approximately 28% (excluding dividends, fees and charges).
Credit Suisse 27/04/2010 3 Downgrade to Neutral from Outperform $38.00 14.4%

Target $38.00 (was $40.50). Following the Baxter quarterly result the broker has cut its earnings forecasts for CSL by 3-7% to reflect a show-down in IVIG volumes and changes to currency price forecasts.

While it expects CSL to continue to gain market share the broker suggests the current uncertainty with respect to pricing is likely to limit share price performance. To reflect this the broker has downgraded to a Neutral rating.



Target price is $38.00 Current Price is $32.50 Difference: $5.5
If CSL meets the Credit Suisse target it will return approximately 17% (excluding dividends, fees and charges).
BA-Merrill Lynch 23/04/2010 3 Downgrade to Neutral, Medium Risk from Buy $36.60 10.2%

With the Australian market heavily skewed towards the resources sector, one must be concerned about the short - term direction of the market with the issues in the EU i.e Greece, Portugal etc and inflationary issues in Asia and banking reforms in the states... These issues will obviously have an adverse affect globally, in particular resources.

Now... CSL is a defensive stock. It got a battering from news from a competitor (Baxter) outlining that their revenue forecasts were overstated. The market re-acted by heavily selling Baxter in the US and, in turn, CSL in Australia. Furthermore, Analysts are stating that Baxters revenue downgrade is possibly due to CSL's increased market capture.

Also from a TA perspective CSL has been oversold.

At the time of writing CSL's price has increased by 2.09%. It fell roughly 10% in the last 2 days. Anyone see the potential dollars here?

These are just my opinions and i hope to hear from others comments. :)

After being immersed in many analysis by credible sources and leading economists, I too share the same opinion that the correction will happen only when the Feds start lifting the interest rates in the USA. However I expected one to happen late last year too. But it did not.

Greece, Portugal etc. is only fluff that the big players use to make profit. GS knew of the Greek fin. situation and used the opportunity to place their bets accordingly. How many times have we heard ""Greece, Greece, Greece"" over last few weeks? Even the media is influencing the game. Greece is broke. They will default. (corruption, inability to repay etc.) Old news! Let's move on. Irrelevant. Watch the markets closely and see if they start moving up again (as they did) well knowing the situation in Greece.

The Yo-yo goes like this;

- Greece fears spook the investors - DOW down.
(next day) - Markets up on a positive outlook (what happened to Greece?)
(day after that) - EU nations in discussions over Greece - markets tread water
- (day after that) - Germany taking the lead role - markets react positively
- (day after that) - (by that time market is up some 100 points or more - positive 1Q attracts risk takers


AND THEN....

BANG - Greece in trouble again - 200 points DOWN!

Well, we knew that 5 days ago, and 2 weeks ago, and 2 months ago...what has changed?

Invest because you are confident in a particular company and after you've done a thorough research. Do not invest because someone speculates that there is a possibility of market correction. Sure, it will happen eventually, but WHEN?

Not one person on this planet knows the answer to that question, I assure you of that.

April 25, 2010

SO GOLDMAN Sachs, the world's greatest and smuggest investment bank, has been sued for fraud by the American Securities and Exchange Commission. Legally, the case hangs on a technicality.

Morally, however, the case may turn into a final referendum on the greed-is-good ethos that conquered America in the '80s - and in the years since has aped other horrifying American trends in spreading across the Western world like a venereal disease.

When the globe was engulfed in the flood of defaults and derivative losses that emerged from the collapse of the US housing bubble two years ago, few understood that the crash had its roots in the lunatic greed-centred objectivist religion, fostered in the '50s and '60s by ponderous emigre novelist Ayn Rand.

Outside America, Russian-born Rand is probably best known for being the unfunniest person Western civilisation has seen since maybe Goebbels or Jack the Ripper, but inside America she is upheld as an intellectual giant. Her ideas are worshipped even by people who've never heard of her. The right-wing Tea Party movement is just one example of an entire demographic that has been inspired to mass protest by Rand without even knowing it.

Last year I wrote a brutally negative article about Goldman Sachs for /Rolling Stone/ (I called the bank a ''great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity'') that sparked a heated debate. On one side were people who believed that Goldman is little better than a criminal enterprise that bilks the market, the government, and even its own clients in a bewildering variety of complex financial scams.

On the other were those who argued Goldman wasn't guilty of anything except being ''too smart'' and really good at making money. This was based almost entirely on the Randian belief system, under which the leaders of Goldman Sachs appear not as the cheap swindlers they look like to me, but idealised heroes, the saviours of society.

In the Randian ethos, called objectivism, the only real morality is self-interest, and society is divided into groups who are efficiently self-interested (the rich) and the ''parasites'' who wish to take their earnings through taxes. Rand believed government had virtually no natural role in society. She conceded police were necessary, but refused to accept any need for economic regulation.

Rand's fingerprints are all over the Goldman story. The case involves a hedge fund financier, John Paulson, who went to Goldman with the idea of a synthetic derivative package pegged to risky US mortgages, for use in betting against the mortgage market. Paulson would short the package and Goldman would then sell the deal to suckers. The SEC's contention is that Goldman committed a crime when they failed to tell the suckers about the vulture betting against them on the other side of the deal.

The instruments in question - collateralised debt obligations and credit default swaps - fall into the category of derivatives, which are virtually unregulated in the US thanks in large part to the effort of former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, a staunch Randian. In the late '90s, Greenspan lobbied hard for a law that deregulated the sort of interest-rate swaps Goldman used in its now-infamous dealings with Greece.

*In the Paulson deal the suckers were European banks such as ABN-Amro and IKB, which were never told the stuff Goldman was selling to them was, in effect, designed to implode; in the Greece deal, Goldman used exotic swaps to help the country mask its financial problems, then bet against Greece by shorting the debt.*

Confronted with public outrage, the leaders of Goldman will often appear genuinely confused. It's not an act. There have been a lot of greedy financiers and banks in history, but what makes Goldman stand out is its truly bizarre cultist/religious belief in the rightness of what it does.

The point was driven home in England last year, when Goldman's international adviser, sounding exactly like a character in /Atlas Shrugged/, said ''The injunction of Jesus to love others as ourselves is an endorsement of self-interest.''

Even if he stands to make a buck at it, your average used-car salesman won't sell some working father a car with wobbly brakes, then buy life insurance policies on that customer and his kids. But this is done almost as a matter of routine in the financial services industry, where the attitude after the inevitable pileup would be that that family was dumb for getting into the car in the first place. Caveat emptor, dude!

This Randian mindset is now ingrained in the American character.

This debate is going to be crystallised in the Goldman case. Much of America is going to reflexively insist that Goldman's only crime was being better at making money than IKB and ABN-Amro, and that the meddling government (in the American narrative, always the bad guy) should get off Goldman's Armani-clad back. Another side is going to argue that Goldman winning this case would be a rebuke to the whole idea of civilisation - which, after all, is really just a collective decision by all of us not to screw each other over even when we can.

It's an important moment in the history of modern global capitalism: whether or not to move forward into a world of greed without limits.

I should have said CSL would bounce like a steel ball dropped from a great height, rather than being a released spring. Either way, major moves in markets or stocks almost always are followed by counter moves, before the underlying trend overcomes the action.

I would be surprised if CSL quickly recovers to where it was in the last 2 strong weeks. Rather, I'm expecting some strong selling to pull it down towards the 30 range, and maybe even below. Of course, if the US dollar becomes the sacred haven as the markets are pointing to then CSL should benefit and overcome its spate of bad press of late and to fight the tide being pulled from under it.

The timing has been all wrong, as CSL was well and truly ready to rise above all others during this historical period in the markets. The truth in global economies is starting to come home to roost, and that is that money actually doesn't grow on trees - that those who are responsible for believing that it actually is are being punished, and that credit is rapidly becoming a privelage and not a right!

Credit ratings are now going to be the 'in theme', and various nations and banks will be vigilant not to have their ratings dropped to junk status (a al Greece). The end result will be the soarest of hangovers this generation will have ever experience and most will be demanding what the hell is going on!

The bottom line is that no trend lasts forever, yet most are incapable of thinking 'outside a trend'. So when the unthinkable happends then the enevitable result is fierce.

Think tulips, the roaring 20s, GM Motors, Kodak, the US housing market - these trends were real, at leat they appeared to have had the majority bluffed until the truth surfaced.

I'm just a little negative right now; my way of thinking is that we are on a knife's edge, and kind of on the wrong side. Our economies globally are one big fake scam, where we have all been conned into believing things are actually better than they are; how else is anyone going to sign up a $600,000 mortgage that's gonna take him and his wife the bast part of their adult lives to repay!

Both scenarios or two types of investors are right but can be wrong too, all depends on their risk factor, capital position, goal, experience. Looking at your post I am sure not many posters here are capable of holding CSL or others on top of what you have at the amount you mentioned which was 30k and that is over 1 millions bucks and not many people here have that capacity and have capital enough to hold when they make a wrong decision.
Regular, you have a strong position and able to top up everytime it drops by $1 and you have to realise not everyone have that capacity and being in your position obviously your strategy works for you and might not work for someone else and you can hold and collect divs.
Other traders might not have this position where they can hold and keep buying when they make a wrong move so everyone is different and nothing wrong or right as long as the end result is satisfactory for them then it is the right strategy for them.

Baxter Shares Plummet on Reduced 2010 Outlook

NEW YORK (AP) -- Shares of Baxter International plunged Thursday after the company cut its full-year profit outlook on slower-than-expected sales of plasma-based drugs and charges related to health care reform.

In 2010, the company expects profit between $3.92 and $4 per share, down from a previous range of $4.20 to $4.28 per share. It cited increased Medicaid rebates included in the health care overhaul as well as greater competition in the market for plasma-based therapies used to treat hemophilia, immune disorders and other diseases.

""We, in retrospect, were clearly overly optimistic about the short-term market growth, our ability to retain market share and the near-term impact on the market of deploying additional sales resources"" said Chief Executive Robert Parkinson

Shares of the Deerfield, Ill.-based fell 9.82, or 16.7 percent, to $49.29 in morning trading.

The sell-off came despite a 2 percent rise in first-quarter profit on a boost of bioscience and kidney care products.

Baxter earned $525 million, or 86 cents per share, in the quarter ended in March, up from $516 million, or 83 cents per share, a year prior.

Sales rose 11 percent to $3.14 billion from $2.82 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, sales increased 5 percent.

Excluding items, the company says it earned 93 cents per share, matching Wall Street expectations. The company posted a charge of $39 million, or 7 cents per share, related to health care reform.

Management estimated health reform-related costs would total $80 million, or 10 cents per share, for all of 2010.
During the second quarter, the company expects profit between 90 cents and 93 cents per share.

Analysts, on average, expect second-quarter profit of $1.06 per share and full-year profit of $4.24 per share.",LT

Doubts over short-term earnings at CSL

DEFENSIVE stocks are supposedly back in vogue as attention re-focuses on Greece's debt problem and similar woes afflicting that other ancient superpower, Portugal.
Or maybe it's just a case of bored Wall Street traders finding something to obsess about in the absence of any real economic data.

CSL is supposedly a bomb-proof (healthcare) stock, but there's now a question mark over its short-term earnings, following US plasma rival Baxter's profit warning for calendar 2010, which was released last Friday.
Baxter also pared back its forecast for full-year sales growth, from 5-7 per cent to 1-3 per cent.
Interestingly, Baxter cited the poor economy, which suggests that demand for some plasma products is more discretionary than assumed.

Theoretically, ObamaCare is positive because it expands the potential base of patients with an ability to pay. But Baxter estimates the scheme will cost $US80 million ($86.3m), the result of having to provide either rebates to the state, or discounts to accredited healthcare providers.

It's not a well understood aspect of the convoluted US healthcare system and there could be further scares.
CSL shares slumped $2.66 last Friday, and a further $1.45 this morning, taking total losses to a blood-curdling 11 per cent. Whether that makes for a buying opportunity - or a portent of worse to come - depends on whether CSL is taking market-share from Baxter.

Two firms -- Citi and JP Morgan -- are convinced that it's a case of lost market-share rather than poor fundamental conditions, which bodes well for CSL.

Credit Suisse argues CSL has more product diversification (a subcutaneous delivery product, for example) and seemingly stable growth in key products such as albumin and clotting factors.

CSL also has a lower skew to the US, deriving half of its sales there, compared with 70 per cent for Baxter.
On the flip side, Baxter has hinted that it will need to discount to stem market-share losses, which harks back to a savage price war in 2002-03.

In a heartening move, CSL on Friday stuck with its full-year earnings guidance of $970m to $1.07 billion (depending on the exchange rate).

We'll get further evidence when US competitor Talecris, which CSL tried to buy, reports its first-quarter results next month.

Criterion pegged back CSL from a long-term buy to a HOLD at $35.25 on March 24, and we'll stick in this safe territory.
Depending on who you talk to, CSL is either wildly undervalued, or else rashly priced for blue-sky growth, which can't be achieved without a major new product.

In the meantime, CSL has close to $1b burning a hole in its pocket, which is nice (but a drag on earnings).",ST

9663,,,,,,2010-04-27,hotwolf,5418.0,130.0,23/04/2010,10:15:00 AM,"NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Concerns abounded about stocks related to the plasma-based medical products business Thursday after Baxter International Inc. (BAX) cited weakness in the sector.

Slowing sales in Baxter's biosciences division, which makes life-saving drugs from human plasma, had raised concerns ahead of the results, but the company explicitly said Thursday it had overestimated strength in the market.

The news, which came as Baxter slashed its full-year outlook, weighed on competitor Talecris Biotherapeutics Corp. (TLCR), the third-largest producer of plasma medicines in the U.S., behind Australia-based CSL Ltd. (CSL.AU) and market leader Baxter. It also hurt shares of Haemonetics Corp. (HAE), a maker of automated blood-processing systems that has a large plasma-collection business.

Talecris' shares were recently down 13% at $19.19. The stock is off 14% so far this year and 9.3% since Oct. 1, the first day it traded after its initial public offering. Haemonetics fell 5.5% to $57.26. Baxter, meanwhile, was off 14% at $50.81.

A spokeswoman for Talecris said the company had no comment on the declines.

Baxter Chairman and Chief Executive Robert L. Parkinson Jr. said the company's prior short-term forecasts for the plasma-based medical products segment were ""overly optimistic.""

""The facts are we mis-called this,"" he said. ""Clearly the market is growing much more slowly than we had anticipated.""

BWS Financial analyst Hamed Khorsand said there wasn't a significant amount of detail in Baxter's report as to what happened in the quarter--just that some plasma products had soft sales.

But the comments, coupled with Baxter's 28-cent-a-share forecast cut, are weighing on Talecris, he said. Baxter wasn't clear whether the problems in the plasma market were specific to it, he said, which creates concern around Talecris before its report for the most recent quarter, which is set for May 5.

However, Talecris isn't Baxter, Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Reames wrote in a note to clients. He said Talecris has gained 6% market share from its competitors in the U.S. in the last 18 months, a trend he thinks will continue.

""We continue to believe the outlook for Talecris is solid,"" Reames said.

In February, Talecris said it had seen strong volume growth across its business.

Other main competitors in the space include privately held Swiss firm Octapharma AG and Grifols SA (GIKLY, GRF.MC). Grifols' American depositary shares were off 12% at $6.93 on very low volume--but typically only a few hundred of the ADSs change hands every day.

Avondale Partners' Dan Owczarski said the news from Baxter could hurt Haemonetics' next few quarters' performance. Haemonetics had already warned recently that volume growth in the plasma-collection segment was only about 2%, he said, so the company had seen already that collection volumes had slowed a bit more than expected.

The news from Baxter reiterates that demand has paused in the space, and collections for Haemonetics will likely have slowed when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results May 4. It will likely cause an overhang on the stock at least until then, when the market can get some commentary from Haemonetics, Owczarski said.

BWS' Khorsand also said Wall Street has to price in health-care reform, which will have some impact on Talecris as Medicare rebates increase. Baxter and others have referred to the impact from the reform.",Hold

DRUG regulators are urgently investigating whether the seasonal flu vaccine is safe for children, after the nation's top doctor said they shouldn't receive it.

Australia's chief medical officer Jim Bishop said health professionals should stop immunising children under five-years-old with the vaccine immediately. Professor Bishop is concerned about a spike in the number of West Australian youngsters experiencing fever and convulsions after getting the shot.

""This is a precautionary measure while the matter is being urgently investigated by health experts and the Therapeutic Goods Administration,"" he said.

The drug regulator is trying to establish whether the bad reactions reported in WA are related to the vaccine, or whether there is a problem with how it is administered.

Prof Bishop said the TGA had contacted vaccine manufacturer CSL to identify which batches of the medicine had been sent to WA, and get samples of them for testing.

End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar.
""The TGA is convening an expert scientific advisory panel to review the information from WA, and is seeking additional information from the manufacturer, CSL Ltd, and from regulatory colleagues internationally,"" he said.

The Department of Health and Ageing is also conducting its own inquiries into the issue, and states and territories are being encouraged to report any cases of fever or convulsion following the immunisation to the TGA.

Prof Bishop said those over the age of five could still receive the seasonal swine flu vaccine, while the swine flu shot was still safe for everyone - including children - to use, too.

""It is expected that the dominant flu this winter season will be swine flu and the specific Panvax vaccine is available free for all Australians,"" he said.",Buy

ELI GREENBLAT
April 23, 2010 - 12:37PM

Shares in blood plasma group CSL recorded their biggest intra-day fall since November 2008 after chief United States-based rival Baxter International slashed its full-year profit forecast due to health reform costs and a weaker plasma protein market.

CSL fell 9.5 per cent in local trade as investors reacted to Baxter's release of its first-quarter earnings performance, before the stock trimmed its losses to be down $2.64, or 7.2 per cent, at $33.96 in early afternoon trading.

The dive in the share price erased solid gains made by CSL since the beginning of the year and taken the stock to near a three-month low.

When Baxter cut its earnings guidance overnight, jittery investors sent its shares down 14 per cent. Talecris Biotherapeutics, another US blood plasma group which CSL attempted to acquire last year, fell 13 per cent.

CSL is the second largest blood plasma company in the US, sitting behind Baxter.

In 2008-09 North America made up 38 per cent of CSL's total revenue of more than $5 billion.

Australian analysts said that while CSL was likely to have experienced similar market conditions as Baxter in the US, CSL recently achieved favourable reimbursement terms for its liquid blood plasma product Privigen.

Also, US-based healthcare buying groups have preferred other products over Baxter, benefiting CSL.

One analyst said CSL would be affected by the Medicaid rebate increase in the US, hacking $10 million to $15 million from its annual net profit. Medicaid is a means-tested health program for low-income Americans.

Baxter's missteps

Baxter chief executive Bob Parkinson said that in the face of a weak US economy the company's range of life-saving blood plasma therapeutics were more ""optional"" than anticipated by the company.

""The facts are we miscalled this,"" Mr Parkinson told US analysts on a conference call.
""Clearly the market is growing much more slowly than we anticipated.""

Baxter has lowered its outlook for 2010 earnings to a range of $US3.92 to $US4 per share from its previous forecast of $US4.20 to $US4.28. The company said it now expected sales growth of only 1 per cent to 3 per cent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, down from its prior outlook of 5 per cent to 7 per cent.

The earnings warning includes an estimated $US80 million hit from US healthcare reform legislation as expanded Medicaid rebates will affect its hemophilia and plasma businesses, the company said.

What are your thoughts on what has transpired today with CSL? Fundamentally, i personally believe this was market overreaction with the selling. CSL confirmed this by outlining that they are still in line with estimates earlier this month.

Many institutions will have used this opportunity to load up more at the discounted price. However, many will use the inevitable bounce to offload. Very rarely do we see straight 'V' type falls and recoveries - so I would expect the wild swings to reduce over the next week or so before we know where we stand. Anyone who's loaded up should be trigger happy for any weakness.

Don't be surprised to see further and deeper falls over the next few weeks. But unlike penny dreadfuls that have no backbone, CSL is fundamentally one of the darlings of the world. Holding a sick CSL is a lot easier simply because of its value, growth potential and demand regardless of economic conditions. When it's weak, it usually doesn't stay down for long.

It's all about offensive action, taking the cream of your success. This is the 2nd time I've taken good profit out of this company after buying it at 28.85 last May. Took profits at around 35 later last year, then watched the price retreat towards 30 again. Because I took profit at 35 I was not ticked off in the slightest about the pullback, and I didn't sell out as a result of the negative price action.

I'm a firm believer of profit taking - put it this way; it should be viewed as taking out insurance against a fall. But unlike any insurance policy which costs you money, profit taking is your payment for success. It puts you in good stead for any eventual pullback. Rather then panicking about loosing great profits you're more relaxed and less emotional about the market negatives.

The beauty is that if the market pushes CSL down again to the low 30s then I will use the money made on profit taking to buy back more shares than what I had sold. It's effectively gaining shares for free.

A large gap formed near the start of that rally that I believe will need to be filled. That gap also coincides with two previous swing highs and will most likely form a key support area in the future.
There was an almost identical move in August with a large bearish engulfing pattern and a short term double top like now. An identical down move would see the gap filled.

Claire Gordon, a 28-year-old trainee infectious disease specialist from the Austin Hospital, was working in the intensive care unit last year as a 22-year-old pregnant woman fought for her life there.

''She was so sick - we were so concerned she would not get through the illness,'' Dr Gordon said.

''And there was a young baby involved as well. We were doing our best to try to pull her through, asking ourselves if there was something else we were missing.''

After consulting colleagues, she ordered an expensive and rarely used test of the patient's immunoglobulin sub-types. These are ''spotter'' proteins that tag invaders for the immune system to hunt and destroy. To her surprise, the patient had extremely low levels of one particular sub-class, called IgG2.

Dr Gordon realised she might have stumbled on to the key to a mystery that had baffled experts since the swine flu epidemic began: why it was serious, even fatal, to some people but barely gave the sniffles to others.

She ordered tests for other hospital patients with swine flu and the pattern was confirmed: the sicker they were, the lower their IgG2 levels.

When injected with the protein, the patients began to get better almost immediately - including the young mother.

''It was very exciting - this is the first time [IgG2] has been associated with swine flu.

''It gave us something else to work on and think about, an exciting clue to the puzzle,'' Dr Gordon said.

The hospital's head of infectious diseases, Professor Lindsay Grayson, said it was early days and it was hard to be sure about precise cause and effect but Dr Gordon's was a fascinating discovery that had attracted international attention.

It was published yesterday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. ''For the first time, we may be able to explain why pregnant women are more likely to get swine flu, why some healthy people get severe swine flu and others don't,'' Professor Grayson said.

''It could also answer why vaccines don't work for a small number of people.''

A fraction of the population - fewer than one in five - naturally has low IgG2 levels, making them more likely to get recurrent ear and chest infections. Pregnant women also have temporarily low IgG2 levels.

The discovery made it especially important that such people got the flu vaccine this year before swine flu returned, Professor Grayson said.

The team's next step is to determine if an IgG2 injection is a genuine ''cure'' for swine flu. Several other Melbourne hospitals have been recruited into the trial, and results will be published later in the year.

They will also examine whether there is a particular relationship between swine flu and the IgG2 protein - or whether it has wider implications for treating other influenza types.",LT
